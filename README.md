# Readable Project

This is the second project of React Nanodegree course in Udacity.
Here I used Redux! And CSS.

Please follow these steps to run this project in your computer:

1. Download the repos. You could use git clone, or click the button 'Download as ZIP'
    a. Download the backend server here: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter
    b. Download this readable project
3. Go to the folder where you put the backend, and 'cd to api-server'.
4. Once inside the api-server folder, you need to run:
    a. npm install
    b. node server or npm start
2. Open another terminal and go to the 'readable' project, then run:
    a. npm install
    b. npm start

And that's it!
